## A Gentle Introduction to `torch.autograd`

`torch.autograd` is PyTorch’s automatic differentiation engine that powers neural network training. In this section, you will get a conceptual understanding of how autograd helps a neural network train.

### Background

Neural networks (NNs) are a collection of nested functions that are executed on some input data. These functions are defined by _parameters_ (consisting of weights and biases), which in PyTorch are stored in tensors.

Training a NN happens in two steps:

**Forward Propagation**: In forward prop, the NN makes its best guess about the correct output. It runs the input data through each of its functions to make this guess.

**Backward Propagation**: In backprop, the NN adjusts its parameters proportionate to the error in its guess. It does this by traversing backwards from the output, collecting the derivatives of the error with respect to the parameters of the functions (_gradients_), and optimizing the parameters using gradient descent.

### Usage in PyTorch

Let’s take a look at a single training step. For this example, we load a pretrained resnet18 model from `torchvision`. We create a random data tensor to represent a single image with 3 channels, and height & width of 64, and its corresponding `label` initialized to some random values. Label in pretrained models has shape (1,1000).

!!! note

    This tutorial work only on CPU and will not work on GPU (even if tensor are moved to CUDA).

=== "Code"

    ```python
    import torch
    from torchvision.models import resnet18, ResNet18_Weights
    model = resnet18(weights=ResNet18_Weights.DEFAULT)
    data = torch.rand(1, 3, 64, 64)
    labels = torch.rand(1, 1000)
    ```

    100%|##########| 44.7M/44.7M [00:00<00:00, 93.1MB/s]
    ```

Next, we run the input data through the model through each of its layers to make a prediction. This is the **forward pass**.

```python
prediction = model(data) # forward pass
```

We use the model’s prediction and the corresponding label to calculate the error (`loss`). The next step is to backpropagate this error through the network. Backward propagation is kicked off when we call `.backward()` on the error tensor. Autograd then calculates and stores the gradients for each model parameter in the parameter’s `.grad` attribute.

```python
loss = (prediction - labels).sum()
loss.backward() # backward pass
```

Next, we load an optimizer, in this case SGD with a learning rate of 0.01 and momentum of 0.9. We register all the parameters of the model in the optimizer.

```python
optim = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-2, momentum=0.9)
```

Finally, we call `.step()` to initiate gradient descent. The optimizer adjusts each parameter by its gradient stored in `.grad`.

```python
optim.step() #gradient descent
```

At this point, you have everything you need to train your neural network. The below sections detail the workings of autograd - feel free to skip them.

### Differentiation in Autograd

Let’s take a look at how `autograd` collects gradients. We create two tensors `a` and `b` with `requires_grad=True`. This signals to `autograd` that every operation on them should be tracked.

```python
import torch

a = torch.tensor([2., 3.], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor([6., 4.], requires_grad=True)
```

We create another tensor `Q` from `a` and `b`.

$$
Q = 3a^3 - b^2
$$

```python
Q = 3*a**3 - b**2
```

Let’s assume `a` and `b` to be parameters of an NN, and `Q` to be the error. In NN training, we want gradients of the error with respect to parameters, i.e.

$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial a} = 9a^2
$$

$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial b} = -2b
$$

When we call `.backward()` on `Q`, autograd calculates these gradients and stores them in the respective tensors’ `.grad` attribute.

We need to explicitly pass a `gradient` argument in `Q.backward()` because it is a vector. `gradient` is a tensor of the same shape as `Q`, and it represents the gradient of Q with respect to itself, i.e.

$$
\frac{dQ}{dQ} = 1
$$

Equivalently, we can also aggregate Q into a scalar and call backward implicitly, like `Q.sum().backward()`.

```python
external_grad = torch.tensor([1., 1.])
Q.backward(gradient=external_grad)
```

Gradients are now deposited in `a.grad` and `b.grad`.

=== "Code"

    ```python
    # check if collected gradients are correct
    print(9*a**2 == a.grad)
    print(-2*b == b.grad)
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    tensor([True, True])
    tensor([True, True])
    ```

### Optional Reading - Vector Calculus using `autograd`

Mathematically, if you have a vector valued function $\vec{y}=f(\vec{x})$, then the gradient of $\vec{y}$ with respect to $\vec{x}\$ is a Jacobian matrix $J$:

$$
J =
 \left(\begin{array}{cc}
 \frac{\partial \bf{y}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp;
 ... &amp;
 \frac{\partial \bf{y}}{\partial x_{n}}
 \end{array}\right) =
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
 \frac{\partial y_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial y_{1}}{\partial x_{n}}\\
 \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
 \frac{\partial y_{m}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial y_{m}}{\partial x_{n}}
 \end{array}\right)
$$

Generally speaking, `torch.autograd` is an engine for computing vector-Jacobian product. That is, given any vector $\vec{v}$, compute the product $J^{T}\cdot \vec{v}$.

If $\vec{v}$ happens to be the gradient of a scalar function $l=g\left(\vec{y}\right)$:

$$
\vec{v} =
 \left(\begin{array}{ccc}\frac{\partial l}{\partial y_{1}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial l}{\partial y_{m}}\end{array}\right)^{T}
$$

then by the chain rule, the vector-Jacobian product would be the gradient of $l$ with respect to $\vec{x}$:

$$
J^{T}\cdot \vec{v}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
 \frac{\partial y_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial y_{m}}{\partial x_{1}}\\
 \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
 \frac{\partial y_{1}}{\partial x_{n}} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial y_{m}}{\partial x_{n}}
 \end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
 \frac{\partial l}{\partial y_{1}}\\
 \vdots\\
 \frac{\partial l}{\partial y_{m}}
 \end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
 \frac{\partial l}{\partial x_{1}}\\
 \vdots\\
 \frac{\partial l}{\partial x_{n}}
 \end{array}\right)
$$

This characteristic of vector-Jacobian product is what we use in the above example; `external_grad` represents $\vec{v}$.

### Computational Graph

Conceptually, autograd keeps a record of data (tensors) & all executed operations (along with the resulting new tensors) in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) consisting of `Function` objects. In this DAG, leaves are the input tensors, roots are the output tensors. By tracing this graph from roots to leaves, you can automatically compute the gradients using the chain rule.

In a forward pass, autograd does two things simultaneously:

- run the requested operation to compute a resulting tensor, and

- maintain the operation’s _gradient function_ in the DAG.

The backward pass kicks off when `.backward()` is called on the DAG root. `autograd` then:

- computes the gradients from each `.grad_fn`,

- accumulates them in the respective tensor’s `.grad` attribute, and

- using the chain rule, propagates all the way to the leaf tensors.

Below is a visual representation of the DAG in our example. In the graph, the arrows are in the direction of the forward pass. The nodes represent the backward functions of each operation in the forward pass. The leaf nodes in blue represent our leaf tensors `a` and `b`.

<figure markdown>
  ![001](https://github.com/SAEMC/Images-MLDL/blob/main/pytorch/ch-002/001/001.png?raw=true){ load=lazy }
</figure>

!!! note

    **DAGs are dynamic in PyTorch**. An important thing to note is that the graph is recreated from scratch; after each `.backward()` call, autograd starts populating a new graph. This is exactly what allows you to use control flow statements in your model; you can change the shape, size and operations at every iteration if needed.

### Exclusion from the DAG

`torch.autograd` tracks operations on all tensors which have their `requires_grad` flag set to `True`. For tensors that don’t require gradients, setting this attribute to `False` excludes it from the gradient computation DAG.

The output tensor of an operation will require gradients even if only a single input tensor has `requires_grad=True`.

=== "Code"

    ```python
    x = torch.rand(5, 5)
    y = torch.rand(5, 5)
    z = torch.rand((5, 5), requires_grad=True)

    a = x + y
    print(f"Does `a` require gradients? : {a.requires_grad}")
    b = x + z
    print(f"Does `b` require gradients?: {b.requires_grad}")
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    Does `a` require gradients? : False
    Does `b` require gradients?: True
    ```

In a NN, parameters that don’t compute gradients are usually called **frozen parameters**. It is useful to “freeze” part of your model if you know in advance that you won’t need the gradients of those parameters (this offers some performance benefits by reducing autograd computations).

Another common usecase where exclusion from the DAG is important is for finetuning a pretrained network.

In finetuning, we freeze most of the model and typically only modify the classifier layers to make predictions on new labels. Let’s walk through a small example to demonstrate this. As before, we load a pretrained resnet18 model, and freeze all the parameters.

```python
from torch import nn, optim

model = resnet18(weights=ResNet18_Weights.DEFAULT)

# Freeze all the parameters in the network
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False
```

Let’s say we want to finetune the model on a new dataset with 10 labels. In resnet, the classifier is the last linear layer `model.fc`. We can simply replace it with a new linear layer (unfrozen by default) that acts as our classifier.

```python
model.fc = nn.Linear(512, 10)
```

Now all parameters in the model, except the parameters of `model.fc`, are frozen. The only parameters that compute gradients are the weights and bias of `model.fc`.

```python
# Optimize only the classifier
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-2, momentum=0.9)
```

Notice although we register all the parameters in the optimizer, the only parameters that are computing gradients (and hence updated in gradient descent) are the weights and bias of the classifier.

The same exclusionary functionality is available as a context manager in `torch.no_grad()`.

## Neural Networks

Neural networks can be constructed using the `torch.nn` package.

Now that you had a glimpse of `autograd`, `nn` depends on `autograd` to define models and differentiate them. An `nn.Module` contains layers, and a method `forward(input)` that returns the `output`.

For example, look at this network that classifies digit images:

<figure markdown>
  ![002](https://github.com/SAEMC/Images-MLDL/blob/main/pytorch/ch-002/001/002.png?raw=true){ load=lazy }
</figure>

It is a simple feed-forward network. It takes the input, feeds it through several layers one after the other, and then finally gives the output.

A typical training procedure for a neural network is as follows:

- Define the neural network that has some learnable parameters (or weights)

- Iterate over a dataset of inputs

- Process input through the network

- Compute the loss (how far is the output from being correct)

- Propagate gradients back into the network’s parameters

- Update the weights of the network, typically using a simple update rule: `weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient`

### Define the network

Let’s define this network:

=== "Code"

    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    import torch.nn.functional as F


    class Net(nn.Module):

        def __init__(self):
            super(Net, self).__init__()
            # 1 input image channel, 6 output channels, 5x5 square convolution
            # kernel
            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 6, 5)
            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
            # an affine operation: y = Wx + b
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)  # 5*5 from image dimension
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
            self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

        def forward(self, x):
            # Max pooling over a (2, 2) window
            x = F.max_pool2d(F.relu(self.conv1(x)), (2, 2))
            # If the size is a square, you can specify with a single number
            x = F.max_pool2d(F.relu(self.conv2(x)), 2)
            x = torch.flatten(x, 1) # flatten all dimensions except the batch dimension
            x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
            x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
            x = self.fc3(x)
            return x


    net = Net()
    print(net)
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    Net(
      (conv1): Conv2d(1, 6, kernel_size=(5, 5), stride=(1, 1))
      (conv2): Conv2d(6, 16, kernel_size=(5, 5), stride=(1, 1))
      (fc1): Linear(in_features=400, out_features=120, bias=True)
      (fc2): Linear(in_features=120, out_features=84, bias=True)
      (fc3): Linear(in_features=84, out_features=10, bias=True)
    )
    ```

You just have to define the `forward` function, and the `backward` function (where gradients are computed) is automatically defined for you using `autograd`. You can use any of the Tensor operations in the `forward` function.

The learnable parameters of a model are returned by `net.parameters()`.

=== "Code"

    ```python
    params = list(net.parameters())
    print(len(params))
    print(params[0].size())  # conv1's .weight
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    10
    torch.Size([6, 1, 5, 5])
    ```

Let’s try a random 32x32 input. Note: expected input size of this net (LeNet) is 32x32. To use this net on the MNIST dataset, please resize the images from the dataset to 32x32.

=== "Code"

    ```python
    input = torch.randn(1, 1, 32, 32)
    out = net(input)
    print(out)
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    tensor([[-0.1659,  0.0562,  0.0477, -0.0318,  0.0413,  0.0657,  0.1257,  0.0403,
             -0.0403,  0.0117]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward0>)
    ```

Zero the gradient buffers of all parameters and backprops with random gradients:

```python
net.zero_grad()
out.backward(torch.randn(1, 10))
```

!!! note

    `torch.nn` only supports mini-batches. The entire `torch.nn` package only supports inputs that are a mini-batch of samples, and not a single sample.

    For example, `nn.Conv2d` will take in a 4D Tensor of `nSamples x nChannels x Height x Width`.

    If you have a single sample, just use `input.unsqueeze(0)` to add a fake batch dimension.

Before proceeding further, let’s recap all the classes you’ve seen so far.

**Recap:**

- `torch.Tensor` - A _multi-dimensional array_ with support for autograd operations like `backward()`. Also _holds the gradient_ with respect to the tensor.

- `nn.Module` - Neural network module. _Convenient way of encapsulating parameters_, with helpers for moving them to GPU, exporting, loading, etc.

- `nn.Parameter` - A kind of Tensor, that is _automatically registered as a parameter when assigned as an attribute to_ a `Module`.

- `autograd.Function` - Implements _forward and backward definitions of an autograd operation_. Every `Tensor` operation creates at least a single `Function` node that connects to functions that created a `Tensor` and _encodes its history_.

**At this point, we covered:**

- Defining a neural network

- Processing inputs and calling backward

**Still Left:**

- Computing the loss

- Updating the weights of the network

### Loss Function

A loss function takes the (output, target) pair of inputs, and computes a value that estimates how far away the output is from the target.

There are several different loss functions under the nn package . A simple loss is: `nn.MSELoss` which computes the mean-squared error between the output and the target.

For example:

=== "Code"

    ```python
    output = net(input)
    target = torch.randn(10)  # a dummy target, for example
    target = target.view(1, -1)  # make it the same shape as output
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()

    loss = criterion(output, target)
    print(loss)
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    tensor(1.3131, grad_fn=<MseLossBackward0>)
    ```

Now, if you follow `loss` in the backward direction, using its `.grad_fn` attribute, you will see a graph of computations that looks like this:

```python
input -> conv2d -> relu -> maxpool2d -> conv2d -> relu -> maxpool2d
      -> flatten -> linear -> relu -> linear -> relu -> linear
      -> MSELoss
      -> loss
```

So, when we call `loss.backward()`, the whole graph is differentiated with respect to the neural net parameters, and all Tensors in the graph that have `requires_grad=True` will have their `.grad` Tensor accumulated with the gradient.

For illustration, let us follow a few steps backward:

=== "Code"

    ```python
    print(loss.grad_fn)  # MSELoss
    print(loss.grad_fn.next_functions[0][0])  # Linear
    print(loss.grad_fn.next_functions[0][0].next_functions[0][0])  # ReLU
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    <MseLossBackward0 object at 0x7fb7e85ce470>
    <AddmmBackward0 object at 0x7fb7e85ce530>
    <AccumulateGrad object at 0x7fb7d7d396c0>
    ```

### Backprop

To backpropagate the error all we have to do is to `loss.backward()`. You need to clear the existing gradients though, else gradients will be accumulated to existing gradients.

Now we shall call `loss.backward()`, and have a look at conv1’s bias gradients before and after the backward.

=== "Code"

    ```python
    net.zero_grad()     # zeroes the gradient buffers of all parameters

    print('conv1.bias.grad before backward')
    print(net.conv1.bias.grad)

    loss.backward()

    print('conv1.bias.grad after backward')
    print(net.conv1.bias.grad)
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    conv1.bias.grad before backward
    tensor([0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])
    conv1.bias.grad after backward
    tensor([-0.0105, -0.0071, -0.0024,  0.0185, -0.0060, -0.0071])
    ```

Now, we have seen how to use loss functions.

**Read Later:**

- The neural network package contains various modules and loss functions that form the building blocks of deep neural networks.

**The only thing left to learn is:**

- Updating the weights of the network

### Update the weights

The simplest update rule used in practice is the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):

- `weight = weight - learning_rate * gradient`

We can implement this using simple Python code:

```python
learning_rate = 0.01
for f in net.parameters():
    f.data.sub_(f.grad.data * learning_rate)
```

However, as you use neural networks, you want to use various different update rules such as SGD, Nesterov-SGD, Adam, RMSProp, etc. To enable this, we built a small package: `torch.optim` that implements all these methods. Using it is very simple:

```python
import torch.optim as optim

# create your optimizer
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# in your training loop:
optimizer.zero_grad()   # zero the gradient buffers
output = net(input)
loss = criterion(output, target)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()    # Does the update
```

!!! note

    Observe how gradient buffers had to be manually set to zero using `optimizer.zero_grad()`. This is because gradients are accumulated as explained in the [Backprop](#backprop) section.

## Training a Classifier

This is it. You have seen how to define neural networks, compute loss and make updates to the weights of the network.

Now you might be thinking,

### What about data?

Generally, when you have to deal with image, text, audio or video data, you can use standard python packages that load data into a numpy array. Then you can convert this array into a `torch.*Tensor`.

- For images, packages such as Pillow, OpenCV are useful

- For audio, packages such as scipy and librosa

- For text, either raw Python or Cython based loading, or NLTK and SpaCy are useful

Specifically for vision, we have created a package called `torchvision`, that has data loaders for common datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR10, MNIST, etc. and data transformers for images, viz., `torchvision.datasets` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`.

This provides a huge convenience and avoids writing boilerplate code.

For this tutorial, we will use the CIFAR10 dataset. It has the classes: ‘airplane’, ‘automobile’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’, ‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’. The images in CIFAR-10 are of size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.

</figure>

### Training an image classifier

We will do the following steps in order:

1. Load and normalize the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using `torchvision`

2. Define a Convolutional Neural Network

3. Define a loss function

4. Train the network on the training data

5. Test the network on the test data

#### 1. Load and normalize CIFAR10

Using `torchvision`, it’s extremely easy to load CIFAR10.

```python
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
```

The output of torchvision datasets are PILImage images of range [0, 1]. We transform them to Tensors of normalized range [-1, 1].

=== "Code"

    ```python
    transform = transforms.Compose(
        [transforms.ToTensor(),
         transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))])

    batch_size = 4

    trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,
                                            download=True, transform=transform)
    trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=batch_size,
                                              shuffle=True, num_workers=2)

    testset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False,
                                           download=True, transform=transform)
    testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=batch_size,
                                             shuffle=False, num_workers=2)

    classes = ('plane', 'car', 'bird', 'cat',
               'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck')
    ```

Let us show some of the training images, for fun.

=== "Code"

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    # functions to show an image


    def imshow(img):
        img = img / 2 + 0.5     # unnormalize
        npimg = img.numpy()
        plt.imshow(np.transpose(npimg, (1, 2, 0)))
        plt.show()


    # get some random training images
    dataiter = iter(trainloader)
    images, labels = next(dataiter)

    # show images
    imshow(torchvision.utils.make_grid(images))
    # print labels
    print(' '.join(f'{classes[labels[j]]:5s}' for j in range(batch_size)))
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```

#### 2. Define a Convolutional Neural Network

Copy the neural network from the Neural Networks section before and modify it to take 3-channel images (instead of 1-channel images as it was defined).

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F


class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1) # flatten all dimensions except batch
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x


net = Net()
```

#### 3. Define a Loss function and optimizer

Let’s use a Classification Cross-Entropy loss and SGD with momentum.

```python
import torch.optim as optim

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
```

#### 4. Train the network

This is when things start to get interesting. We simply have to loop over our data iterator, and feed the inputs to the network and optimize.

=== "Code"

    ```python
    for epoch in range(2):  # loop over the dataset multiple times

        running_loss = 0.0
        for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
            # get the inputs; data is a list of [inputs, labels]
            inputs, labels = data

            # zero the parameter gradients
            optimizer.zero_grad()

            # forward + backward + optimize
            outputs = net(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

            # print statistics
            running_loss += loss.item()
            if i % 2000 == 1999:    # print every 2000 mini-batches
                print(f'[{epoch + 1}, {i + 1:5d}] loss: {running_loss / 2000:.3f}')
                running_loss = 0.0

    print('Finished Training')
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    [1,  2000] loss: 2.219
    [1,  4000] loss: 1.909
    [1,  6000] loss: 1.690
    [1,  8000] loss: 1.565
    [1, 10000] loss: 1.533
    [1, 12000] loss: 1.482
    [2,  2000] loss: 1.423
    [2,  4000] loss: 1.385
    [2,  6000] loss: 1.368
    [2,  8000] loss: 1.327
    [2, 10000] loss: 1.324
    [2, 12000] loss: 1.316
    Finished Training
    ```

Let’s quickly save our trained model:

```python
PATH = './cifar_net.pth'
torch.save(net.state_dict(), PATH)
```

#### 5. Test the network on the test data

We have trained the network for 2 passes over the training dataset. But we need to check if the network has learnt anything at all.

We will check this by predicting the class label that the neural network outputs, and checking it against the ground-truth. If the prediction is correct, we add the sample to the list of correct predictions.

Okay, first step. Let us display an image from the test set to get familiar.

=== "Code"

    ```python
    dataiter = iter(testloader)
    images, labels = next(dataiter)

    # print images
    imshow(torchvision.utils.make_grid(images))
    print('GroundTruth: ', ' '.join(f'{classes[labels[j]]:5s}' for j in range(4)))
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    GroundTruth:  cat   ship  ship  plane
    ```

<figure markdown>
  ![005](https://github.com/SAEMC/Images-MLDL/blob/main/pytorch/ch-002/001/005.png?raw=true){ load=lazy }
</figure>

Next, let’s load back in our saved model (note: saving and re-loading the model wasn’t necessary here, we only did it to illustrate how to do so):

=== "Code"

    ```python
    net = Net()
    net.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH))
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    <All keys matched successfully>
    ```

Okay, now let us see what the neural network thinks these examples above are:

```python
outputs = net(images)
```

The outputs are energies for the 10 classes. The higher the energy for a class, the more the network thinks that the image is of the particular class. So, let’s get the index of the highest energy:

=== "Code"

    ```python
    _, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1)

    print('Predicted: ', ' '.join(f'{classes[predicted[j]]:5s}'
                                  for j in range(4)))
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    Predicted:  cat   plane plane ship
    ```

The results seem pretty good.

Let us look at how the network performs on the whole dataset.

=== "Code"

    ```python
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    # since we're not training, we don't need to calculate the gradients for our outputs
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data in testloader:
            images, labels = data
            # calculate outputs by running images through the network
            outputs = net(images)
            # the class with the highest energy is what we choose as prediction
            _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
            total += labels.size(0)
            correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

    print(f'Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: {100 * correct // total} %')
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: 54 %
    ```

That looks way better than chance, which is 10% accuracy (randomly picking a class out of 10 classes). Seems like the network learnt something.

Hmmm, what are the classes that performed well, and the classes that did not perform well:

=== "Code"

    ```python
    # prepare to count predictions for each class
    correct_pred = {classname: 0 for classname in classes}
    total_pred = {classname: 0 for classname in classes}

    # again no gradients needed
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data in testloader:
            images, labels = data
            outputs = net(images)
            _, predictions = torch.max(outputs, 1)
            # collect the correct predictions for each class
            for label, prediction in zip(labels, predictions):
                if label == prediction:
                    correct_pred[classes[label]] += 1
                total_pred[classes[label]] += 1


    # print accuracy for each class
    for classname, correct_count in correct_pred.items():
        accuracy = 100 * float(correct_count) / total_pred[classname]
        print(f'Accuracy for class: {classname:5s} is {accuracy:.1f} %')
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    Accuracy for class: plane is 71.4 %
    Accuracy for class: car   is 64.1 %
    Accuracy for class: bird  is 37.0 %
    Accuracy for class: cat   is 13.3 %
    Accuracy for class: deer  is 50.1 %
    Accuracy for class: dog   is 54.7 %
    Accuracy for class: frog  is 72.4 %
    Accuracy for class: horse is 69.3 %
    Accuracy for class: ship  is 64.6 %
    Accuracy for class: truck is 48.3 %
    ```

Okay, so what next?

How do we run these neural networks on the GPU?

### Training on GPU

Just like how you transfer a Tensor onto the GPU, you transfer the neural net onto the GPU.

Let’s first define our device as the first visible cuda device if we have CUDA available:

=== "Code"

    ```python
    device = torch.device('cuda:0' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

    # Assuming that we are on a CUDA machine, this should print a CUDA device:

    print(device)
    ```

=== "Out"

    ```
    cuda:0
    ```

The rest of this section assumes that `device` is a CUDA device.

Then these methods will recursively go over all modules and convert their parameters and buffers to CUDA tensors:

```python
net.to(device)
```

Remember that you will have to send the inputs and targets at every step to the GPU too:

```python
inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)
```

Why don’t I notice MASSIVE speedup compared to CPU? Because your network is really small.

**Goals achieved:**

- Understanding PyTorch’s Tensor library and neural networks at a high level.

- Train a small neural network to classify images
